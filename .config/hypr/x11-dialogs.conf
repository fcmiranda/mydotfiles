# This configuration is designed to fix the common annoyance of pop-up windows
# from older X11 applications appearing in awkward positions when running on Wayland.
# It works by identifying specific window types like dialog boxes, splash screens,
# and utility windows, forcing them to float on top of other content and automatically
# centering them on the screen for easy access. A critical exception is added to ensure
# that menus and tooltips are ignored by this rule, allowing them to appear correctly
# next to your cursor as they should.

# windowrulev2 = center, xwayland:1, windowtype:^(dialog|splash|utility)$
